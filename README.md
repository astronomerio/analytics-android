# Open-Source at Metarouter

One of our core values at Metarouter is "openness." We see this manifest in our dedication to open-source. We are relentless to **only invent what we must invent**; to use and contribute to the large and growing body of open-source software that countless developers have selflessly contributed to the world.

And it's not just about receiving value. Open-source is a two-way street. A core element of our business strategy is to open-source the [Aries Framework](github.com/aries-data), with the goal to reduce the amount of time developers waste re-writing integrations.

We also have many open-source projects in [our main Github organization](https://github.com/astronomerio).
